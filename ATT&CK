ATT&CK

This is all from memory so pardon if I've made a mistake to the commands. 
Regardless, It's close enough where you should be able to check what I meant to write.

Recon - 
nmap -sV =script-vul.nse <ip>
enumerates CVEs, 
whois/nslookup <website if applicable - skip if not testing webhost>
link CVE to searchsploit/msfconsole. example ```msfconsole search <CVE number>``` ```use 1, 2, 3 ,4 ```

Initial access
msfconsole, cobalt-strike, havoc, brute-ratel, hydra, bettercap. OtterHugger.

Persistence
lolbas, lolbins, startup, chronjobs, sharpersist.

Priv Esculation
Lolbins, WinPEAS, LinPEAS. (living off land methodology will get you far with Priv-esculation)

OtterHugger will cover the steps inbetween, I've designed this with evasion in mind and this has withstanded antivirus scans. 

Credentials
Migrate to LSASS using metaspoit, MITM, mimikatz

Lateral movement
-covered in persistence, we do it early for efficiency-

Command and Control
We used OtterHugger to wrap a C2. See how we already covered Active Directory and C2s?

Exfil 
- Already done with C2s, stealthier as we have sleep and jitter, data exfil without detection already possible in the 2nd step, use gobuster/dirbuster for webhost, then exfil using OtterHugger -
